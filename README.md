  ## Project
  As a growing developer, I wanted to create an app that will generate
employee badges for companies in need of the resource.

  My criteria for the app:
  * Data will be input through the terminal
  * Pictures can be added
  * Generated badge can be displayed

  ## Description
  I structured a codebase with the following in order to have my app 
to work as intended:
  * Used C# for main choice of language for its conveniency in my experience
  * Followed traditional project file structure for developers
to review conveniently, store data, and organize generated badges.
  * Used "system" directives in order to initialize writing to a 
CSV file
  * Bonus: Enabled the abiblity to generate multiple employee badges fetched
with/without API calls with peopleFetcher
